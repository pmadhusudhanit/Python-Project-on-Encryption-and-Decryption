# Python-Project-on-Encryption-and-Decryption
In this project, a Python application will be developed to encrypt and decrypt messages using various techniques. Users can choose the encryption algorithm and input a unique key. After entering their message, the application will provide the result. This research explores different encryption methods, emphasizing the importance of secure communication in the digital era. In response to the increasing demand for digital security, we will create a program for encoding and decoding messages to protect against cybercrime.
